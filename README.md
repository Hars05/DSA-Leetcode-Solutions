# LeetCode DSA Solutions

A curated collection of my LeetCode solutions focused on building strong
Data Structures & Algorithms fundamentals for technical interviews and
competitive programming.

Solutions emphasize clear logic, optimal complexity, and interview-ready
implementation across multiple programming languages.

## Repository Structure

Each problem is organized in its own folder using the format:

<problem-number>-<problem-name>

Each folder typically contains:
- One or more solution files (language-specific)
- A README explaining:
  - Problem summary
  - Core idea / approach
  - Time and space complexity

---

## Languages Used

- C++
- Java
- Python
- C#

---

## Data Structures Covered

- Arrays & Strings  
- Linked Lists  
- Stacks & Queues  
- Hash Tables / Hash Maps  
- Trees  
- Binary Trees  
- Binary Search Trees  
- Heaps / Priority Queues  
- Graphs  
- Tries *(planned)*
